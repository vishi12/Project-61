        <p>My Hobby is playing cricket. When I got my first cricket bat, and my second from my grandparents, I have been playing cricket a lot since then. When I finish my homeworks and I am free to play, cricket is what first comes to my mind. I also watch cricket as much as I play it. I watch it with my father a lot, and sometimes my whole family watches it together. I mostly like to play cricket with my whole family, but if I have to play with my brother I am also happy to play with him too. I learned cricket like I was born to play it.I like any sport, but I like Cricket the best.</p>
          Cricket is very popular. It is the second biggest spectator sport in the world. Only soccer has more fans.Cricket - 2.5 Billion Fans.
